# 4chan-Thread-Sanitizer
Delete 4chan threads with specific keywords. 

### How do I use this? 

You can use tampermonkey to run the script. Copy the script from [/src/tampermonkey/script.js](https://github.com/fuzzydragon/4chan-Thread-Sanitizer/blob/main/src/tampermonkey/script.js) and create a new tampermonkey script and paste the code in.
Otherwise, you can use some other extension that allows you to inject javascript into your browser. 

### Where can I get an example ignorelist? 

You can navigate to [/src/example blacklist](https://github.com/fuzzydragon/4chan-Thread-Sanitizer/blob/main/src/example%20ignorelist) _warning: offensive content_
